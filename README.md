# A minimalistic highlighter

Token-based highlighter with minimal functionality written in javascript.

# Languages

Lang-pack includes some sort of javascript, python and CLI highlighters.

Probably it won't work on non-trivial code and, maybe, even in some
sort of trivial one.

# Pro

It's small. Probably around 3.5KB when minified (lang-pack included).

Languages could be added easily.

Kinda fast, sometimes.

# Cons

Won't work everywhere (maybe ES5 or more).

Kinda slow, sometimes.

Bugs?
